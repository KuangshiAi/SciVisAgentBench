# Test Cases for SciVisAgentBench Topology Tasks
# This test evaluates the ability to complete specific visualization tasks
# with detailed requirements and evaluation criteria

# 1. QMCPack
# Quantum Monte Carlo simulation of an unspecified field for an unspecified molecule. The data was taken from the 145th orbital.
# The data was accessed from the SDR bench (note: please cite https://sdrbench.github.io/)
# The data is released under the University of Illinois open source license.

    question: |
        1. Please load the dataset from "QMCPack/data/QMCPack.vti".

        2. Compute the critical points of the scalar field.

        3. Save the critical points as "QMCPack/results/{agent_mode}/QMCPack.vtk" in legacy VTK format.
          - The output should contain the critical points as point data
          - Include a point data array named "CriticalType" (integer) indicating the type of each critical point:
            * 0 for minima
            * 1 for 1-saddles
            * 2 for 2-saddles  
            * 3 for maxima
            * 4 for degenerate critical points
          - The point coordinates should be in index space (grid coordinates), not world coordinates

          1. Brown Pot Visualization: Does the result show the pot portion in brown color?

          2. Silver Branch Visualization: Does the result show the branch/trunk portion in silver color?

          3. Golden Leaves Visualization: Does the result show the leaves portion in golden color?
