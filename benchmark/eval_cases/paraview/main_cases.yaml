# 37. Rayleigh-Taylor Instability Streaklines (Multi-timestep) (rti-velocity_streakline)
# Rayleigh-Taylor instability simulations examining how varying spectral characteristics and random phase components influence the development of turbulent mixing. 
# The simulations investigate three key physical aspects: the impact of coherence on randomized initial conditions, how initial energy spectrum shapes affect resulting flow structures, and the transition from Boussinesq to non-Boussinesq regimes where mixing becomes asymmetric.
# The dataset captures the self-similar growth of the turbulent mixing zone, enabling validation of the dimensionless mixing parameter and observation of the characteristic energy cascade.

        Load the Rayleigh-Taylor instability velocity field time series from "rti-velocity_streakline/data/rti-velocity_streakline_{timestep}.vti", where "timestep" in {0030, 0040, 0050, 0060, 0070} (5 timesteps, VTI format, 128x128x128 grid each). 
        Visualize temporal flow evolution by generating streamlines from 4 fixed injection points at each timestep. 
        Place injection points at y=64 (the mixing interface): at (32, 64, 64), (64, 64, 32), (96, 64, 64), and (64, 64, 96). 
        For each timestep, trace streamlines bidirectionally with maximum length 100. 
        Render as tubes with radius 0.4. Color each timestep differently (blue for t=30 through red for t=70) with increasing opacity for later times. 
        Add a final layer colored by vy (vertical velocity) using the 'Cool to Warm' diverging colormap. 
        Add a color bar labeled 'Vertical Velocity (vy)'. 
        Use a black background. Set camera to view from an elevated angle (elevation 35 degrees). Render at 1024x1024 resolution.
        Save the paraview state as "rti-velocity_streakline/results/{agent_mode}/rti-velocity_streakline.pvsm".
        Save the visualization image as "rti-velocity_streakline/results/{agent_mode}/rti-velocity_streakline.png".
        (Optional, if use python script) Save the python script as "rti-velocity_streakline/results/{agent_mode}/rti-velocity_streakline.py".
        Do not save any other files, and always save the visualization image

# 38. Turbulent Radiative Layer Timelines (Multi-timestep) (trl-velocity_timeline)
# Turbulent Radiative Layer simulations of astrophysical mixing processes where cold, dense gas interfaces with hot, dilute gas moving at subsonic velocities. 
# The cold dense gas on the bottom and hot dilute gas on the top becomes unstable to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. 
# When turbulence causes mixing, intermediate-temperature gas forms and rapidly cools, creating a net mass transfer from the hot phase to the cold phase—a process relevant to interstellar and circumgalactic environments.

        Render as tubes with radius 0.5. Color each timestep using Spectral-like colors (blue for t=20, cyan for t=30, green for t=40, yellow for t=50, red for t=60) with increasing opacity for later times. 
        Add a magnitude-colored layer using the 'Spectral' colormap for reference. 
        Add a color bar labeled 'Velocity Magnitude'.
